00:01:17,655 --> 00:01:22,481
<i>New York... one of the biggest cities
in the world</i>

2
00:01:23,218 --> 00:01:24,771
<i>Business capital of the world.</i>

3
00:01:25,897 --> 00:01:28,565
<i>Every breath of the city...every
heartbeat is filled with speed</i>

4
00:01:35,635 --> 00:01:37,615
<i>People are always in a hurry here...</i>

5
00:01:38,417 --> 00:01:41,334
<i>in a hurry to leave home...in a hurry
to reach the office...</i>

6
00:01:41,999 --> 00:01:44,394
<i>always in a hurry to be a
step or two ahead of life</i>

7
00:01:45,268 --> 00:01:47,699
<i>There is no place for anyone
who can't cope here</i>

8
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:55,001
<i>Miles away from India, this city
is infested with Indians</i>

9
00:01:55,944 --> 00:01:58,824
<i>ln fact they say every fourth face
in New York is an Indian</i>

10
00:01:59,387 --> 00:02:00,039
<i>One more thing...</i>

11
00:02:00,604 --> 00:02:02,820
<i>Oh... by the way that's mel</i>

12
00:03:03,899 --> 00:03:06,400
<i>This city taught me
to be independent...</i>

13
00:03:06,993 --> 00:03:09,068
<i>it taught me to fulfill
my responsibilities...</i>

14
00:03:09,428 --> 00:03:11,160
<i>taught me to face life...</i>

15
00:03:12,176 --> 00:03:13,669
<i>...but it couldn't teach me to love...</i>

16
00:03:14,993 --> 00:03:15,716
<i>where was the time?</i>

17
00:03:16,836 --> 00:03:18,460
<i>Whenever I watched the
city from far...</i>

18
00:03:19,305 --> 00:03:21,001
<i>I felt Papa was closer</i>

19
00:03:23,686 --> 00:03:26,639
<i>Whenever I missed him,
I came here</i>

20
00:03:30,921 --> 00:03:36,304
<i>I am Naina Catherine Kapur
and this is my story</i>

21
00:03:43,267 --> 00:03:44,370
I understand Mr.Shah,

22
00:03:44,588 --> 00:03:46,355
but try and understand my problem

23
00:03:47,544 --> 00:03:49,797
I must have the loan extension, please.

24
00:03:51,856 --> 00:03:54,037
I know the restaurant
is centrally situated.

25
00:03:54,256 --> 00:03:57,137
But there's competition
around, Mr. Shah...

26
00:03:57,455 --> 00:04:00,893
<i>My mother, Jennifer.
After Papa passed away...</i>

27
00:04:01,246 --> 00:04:03,427
<i>the entire responsibility
of the family fell on her</i>

28
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:07,502
<i>But she never allowed us to ever
feel the burden of her sorrows</i>

29
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:11,706
Thank you...I.
- I'm home.

30
00:04:13,661 --> 00:04:14,692
Where were you?

31
00:04:16,096 --> 00:04:17,068
Central Park

32
00:04:17,626 --> 00:04:18,634
Central Park? Why?

33
00:04:18,914 --> 00:04:20,894
To meet someone.
- Who?

34
00:04:21,104 --> 00:04:21,934
To meet my boyfriend...

35
00:04:22,669 --> 00:04:26,308
Bill...bills...bills
Private & confidential.

36
00:04:26,529 --> 00:04:27,323
That's mine.

37
00:04:27,816 --> 00:04:29,689
What is this?
It's Sweetu's mail again

38
00:04:29,903 --> 00:04:31,776
When will the mailman understand
that we are Kapur with a 'U'...

39
00:04:31,989 --> 00:04:33,613
and they are Kapoor with an 'O'?
He always...

40
00:04:34,771 --> 00:04:35,494
Were you crying?

41
00:04:35,884 --> 00:04:37,413
No... you were crying...

42
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:38,798
No mom.

43
00:04:39,014 --> 00:04:42,618
<i>My mother and I...
We lied to each other everyday</i>

44
00:04:42,978 --> 00:04:44,009
Kunwari kudi

45
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:47,317
Kunwari kudi marriage bureau,
what's this?

46
00:04:47,534 --> 00:04:48,886
Why don't you ask your grandmother?

47
00:04:49,238 --> 00:04:51,314
It must some new plan
to find you a groom

48
00:04:51,534 --> 00:04:54,273
But I don't want to get married...
Why doesn't Dadi leave me alone?

49
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:55,735
Why doesn't she just leave?

50
00:04:56,403 --> 00:04:58,099
Mom! Where's she?

51
00:04:58,663 --> 00:04:59,671
It's going to be eight...

52
00:05:01,307 --> 00:05:02,930
Hi Guys, 10 seconds to go.

53
00:05:05,548 --> 00:05:07,659
8 seconds to go.

54
00:05:08,296 --> 00:05:11,485
4,3,2,1 ....bang.

55
00:05:12,018 --> 00:05:14,614
<i>My grandmother Lajjo...
She had three dreams</i>

56
00:05:15,043 --> 00:05:17,403
<i>One that New York
becomes a part of Punjab</i>

57
00:05:17,685 --> 00:05:21,848
<i>Two, that I marry a Sardar
and three... that my mother dies</i>

58
00:05:22,312 --> 00:05:26,687
Saraswatiji, Lata, Asha and Usha have
served you with their music for years

59
00:05:27,354 --> 00:05:32,144
But from today Kammo,
Vimmo and I, Lajjo...

60
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:34,443
Hello! will serve you.

61
00:05:34,657 --> 00:05:39,068
So without delay further we are
going to present you a song

62
00:05:39,526 --> 00:05:42,265
The words are 'Pritam come hither...'

63
00:05:43,351 --> 00:05:46,541
The song is specially requested by
our neighbour, Chaddaji from Queens...

64
00:05:48,255 --> 00:05:49,286
That's very kind of you

65
00:05:50,238 --> 00:05:52,870
Kammo... Vimmo...

66
00:05:54,585 --> 00:05:55,829
Go Lajjo...

67
00:05:56,046 --> 00:05:56,697
Go Lajjo...

68
00:05:56,915 --> 00:06:01,563
''Pritam, come hither...''

69
00:06:02,375 --> 00:06:07,273
''Pritam, come hither...''

70
00:06:07,486 --> 00:06:11,518
''My sad heart calls out to you...''

71
00:06:11,729 --> 00:06:17,919
''Pritam, come hither...
Come hither... Come hither...''

72
00:06:18,129 --> 00:06:21,876
Dadi!....Stop it.

73
00:06:22,267 --> 00:06:24,176
Oh God! Interrupted our prayers?

74
00:06:24,389 --> 00:06:25,563
Insulted the goddess?

75
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:26,503
Don't you have any shame?

76
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:27,822
Don't you have any shame?

77
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,772
Singing 'Come hither'
'Come hither' to Chaddaji?

78
00:06:29,988 --> 00:06:32,585
Who's singing it to Chaddaji?
We are singing 'Pritam, come hither'

79
00:06:32,804 --> 00:06:34,915
What is his first name?
- Pritam....

80
00:06:37,047 --> 00:06:37,806
And what is this?

81
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:39,405
What? - This.

82
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:42,956
Wow! Pictures from Kunwari Kudi!

83
00:06:43,169 --> 00:06:45,528
All three of them are so goodlooking

84
00:06:45,742 --> 00:06:47,295
Three? They look
like the same guy

85
00:06:47,515 --> 00:06:48,451
No, no my child...
they are different

86
00:06:48,663 --> 00:06:50,607
Now what is that Kunwari kudi ad?

87
00:06:52,244 --> 00:06:55,399
''Hey girl, Hey Girl, hey Girl...
choose your groom and be free''

88
00:06:55,619 --> 00:06:57,148
''Choose one, two or three''

89
00:06:59,688 --> 00:07:03,197
Dadi, I am not interested in marrying
anyone... one two or three

90
00:07:03,443 --> 00:07:05,803
If you don't marry, my child,
how will you have children?

91
00:07:06,017 --> 00:07:08,590
I can have my children.
There's no need to marry

92
00:07:13,598 --> 00:07:15,922
<i>My brother Shiv, a handicap.</i>

93
00:07:16,241 --> 00:07:18,944
<i>He couldn't play basketball
like the other boys...</i>

94
00:07:19,198 --> 00:07:22,316
<i>but he could be quite irritating
like the other boys</i>

95
00:07:23,197 --> 00:07:24,750
Shiv, put off the T.V.

96
00:07:25,005 --> 00:07:26,499
Whenever I see,
it's always basketball!

97
00:07:26,814 --> 00:07:29,386
Just because I can't play
doesn't mean I can't see...

98
00:07:30,014 --> 00:07:32,444
Don't get cute with me.
All right. Hurry up.

99
00:07:32,656 --> 00:07:33,936
Gia, help your brother.

100
00:07:34,187 --> 00:07:37,281
Didi, did you see my new dolls?
- Gia!

101
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:40,300
This is Mama, this is you...

102
00:07:41,385 --> 00:07:44,859
this is bhaiyya, this is me and...

103
00:07:45,071 --> 00:07:46,944
Oh, so you are awake...!

104
00:07:47,436 --> 00:07:48,680
Looking so good...
like Hari Putter...

105
00:07:48,897 --> 00:07:50,770
Harry Potter, dadi...

106
00:07:50,984 --> 00:07:51,778
Ya ya... whatever... Hari, Harry...

107
00:07:51,992 --> 00:07:53,723
Good morning, dadi.
- Ya Ya...

108
00:07:54,009 --> 00:07:54,804
What's your schedule today?

109
00:07:55,017 --> 00:07:58,315
<i>Dadi's love for Shiv was only
matched by her hatred for Gia</i>

110
00:07:59,087 --> 00:08:04,162
<i>Gia was adopted and probably that's why
Dadi did not consider her, our own</i>

111
00:08:04,616 --> 00:08:09,098
<i>And Gia... She always kept the
Dadi doll away from her perfect family</i>

112
00:08:10,042 --> 00:08:11,666
<i>Distance was not just
between the two in the family...</i>

113
00:08:12,059 --> 00:08:14,975
<i>Guru Nanak and Jesus had
their own battle in the house</i>

114
00:08:20,996 --> 00:08:22,869
It's so cold! Is the heater on?

115
00:08:23,083 --> 00:08:24,221
You are always on, aren't you?

116
00:08:24,438 --> 00:08:25,612
What?- Nothing!

117
00:08:26,665 --> 00:08:28,087
Will it?- Shut up.

118
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:30,515
Bet? - Don't irritate me.

119
00:08:30,735 --> 00:08:32,358
Chicken is just 1 dollar.

120
00:08:32,821 --> 00:08:35,073
What's for breakfast?
- Fruit and cereal

121
00:08:35,290 --> 00:08:37,199
What? - Cereal...

122
00:08:37,481 --> 00:08:39,592
Has it started? The serial
Kahani Ghar Ghar Ki...?

123
00:08:40,298 --> 00:08:42,764
Not the TV serial...
the cereal we eat

124
00:08:42,976 --> 00:08:45,856
So what's new?
That we eat everyday

125
00:08:46,175 --> 00:08:49,294
Poor daughter-in-law... she doesn't
know how to make Indian food

126
00:08:50,453 --> 00:08:51,946
Our dear daughter-in-law, Jenny

127
00:08:54,174 --> 00:08:55,039
Do you know, Naina?

128
00:08:55,251 --> 00:08:57,611
I saw a Lovely dream last night

129
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:00,813
In the dream, I was eating
hot aloo parathas...

130
00:09:01,893 --> 00:09:05,404
with Iots of white butter
Oh... how I missed Chandigarh!

131
00:09:05,616 --> 00:09:08,011
If you miss Chandigarh so much
then you must go away there

132
00:09:08,224 --> 00:09:08,947
What do you think Naina?

133
00:09:09,163 --> 00:09:14,332
I'm going nowhere. If I Ieave,
what wiII happen to these chiIdren?

134
00:09:15,144 --> 00:09:16,840
I'm very concerned about them

135
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:19,725
And I'm concerned onIy about them

136
00:09:19,944 --> 00:09:21,781
Yes of course... why wouId
you be concerned about me?

137
00:09:21,995 --> 00:09:24,663
Who am I to you?
If onIy my son was aIive today...

138
00:09:24,882 --> 00:09:25,463
OnIy if he was aIive...

139
00:09:25,681 --> 00:09:27,590
Stop it. Just stop it.

140
00:09:28,707 --> 00:09:32,039
Here's your doIIar. You won.
As usuaI, are you happy now?

141
00:09:32,393 --> 00:09:34,576
And both of you...just forget it.

142
00:09:35,106 --> 00:09:37,181
<i>My morning began
this same way everyday</i>

143
00:09:37,645 --> 00:09:42,364
<i>Mama and Dadi's fight,
followed by my angry walkout...</i>

144
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:46,295
<i>and then listening to my stupid
neighbour, Sweetu's stupid chatter</i>

145
00:09:47,243 --> 00:09:48,832
Oh Hi!- One minute.

146
00:09:49,051 --> 00:09:51,720
Okay, make that 2 gIaced doughnuts,
2 bIue berry muffins.

147
00:09:51,938 --> 00:09:52,946
2 chocoIate frappechinos.

148
00:09:53,156 --> 00:09:54,056
And what wiII you have?

149
00:09:54,268 --> 00:09:58,857
<i>Sweetu. Full name, Jasprit Kapoor...
Kapoor with two '0's.</i>

150
00:09:59,172 --> 00:10:01,353
<i>my neighbour....
& unfortunately best friend.</i>

151
00:10:01,641 --> 00:10:04,794
<i>She has two problems.
The weight that she never loses...</i>

152
00:10:05,014 --> 00:10:06,996
<i>and the fact that she
never feels sad about it</i>

153
00:10:07,206 --> 00:10:09,802
TeII, Na...
- One doubIe expresso pIease.

154
00:10:10,023 --> 00:10:12,525
Here's your Ietter.
It came again to our house

155
00:10:12,909 --> 00:10:14,498
Your name had to be J. Kapoor...

156
00:10:14,718 --> 00:10:18,429
Oh wow Naina! BIind date appIication.
- What appIication?

157
00:10:18,648 --> 00:10:21,244
It's a very cooI service...
it's very popuIar in New York

158
00:10:21,464 --> 00:10:23,824
Just fiII in a form describing

160

they match the detaiIs and bingo,

161
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:29,590
Wow! And what have you written
about yourseIf?

162
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:31,090
See Naina, I have written
what's the truth... what is... is

163
00:10:31,306 --> 00:10:31,792
What did you write?

164
00:10:32,001 --> 00:10:33,459
That from far,
I Iook Iike Aishwarya Rai...

Look at me. I'm out of controI.

169
00:10:45,774 --> 00:10:48,762
Sweetu, Iook at me...
- I see you everyday...

170
00:10:48,973 --> 00:10:51,712

When wiII our angeI come?

00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:12,973
You were not praying to Saraswati...

Lajjoji... don't shout

368
00:25:58,603 --> 00:26:00,298

He comes to our IocaIity

375
00:26:40,475 --> 00:26:42,455
We were singing so weII and he says

He must be that Chadda's reIative...

Just one thing... is she in
a bad mood or was she born this way?

455
00:33:34,565 --> 00:33:36,474
She has always been Iike this

00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:26,610
So may I have haIf a cup of miIk?

677
00:43:28,106 --> 00:43:28,687
So funny.

678
00:43:28,905 --> 00:43:31,478
See... pIease take this
happy-go-Iucky nature...

679
00:43:31,688 --> 00:43:33,217
and knock on someone eIse's door

680
00:43:33,671 --> 00:43:37,038
And we're genuineIy
not interested.

681
00:43:37,252 --> 00:43:39,125
What happened?
- What's your probIem?

682
00:43:40,034 --> 00:43:43,295
ProbIem?- Yes... why do you feeI...
that the entire weight of the worId

683
00:43:43,511 --> 00:43:44,519
is on your deIicate shouIders?

684
00:43:44,729 --> 00:43:45,738
Who are you?

685
00:43:46,816 --> 00:43:47,990
Don't...

686
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:51,295
What's the point of
praying to God...

687
00:43:51,512 --> 00:43:53,384
when you don't know how to vaIue
the Iife he has given?

688
00:43:53,598 --> 00:43:56,337
What do you know
about my Iife anyway?

689
00:43:56,554 --> 00:43:58,427
Not much, but enough to say..

690
00:43:58,710 --> 00:44:01,034
that in your eyes perhaps
you don't have much

691
00:44:01,248 --> 00:44:03,121
But Iook at your Iife
through someone eIse's eyes...

692
00:44:03,335 --> 00:44:05,730
and you'II know you have a Iot!
- Now I have to hear a Iecture

693
00:44:05,943 --> 00:44:09,038
Listen... Live... be happy..
SmiIe... Who knows?

694
00:44:09,247 --> 00:44:10,421
Tomorrow may not be...

695
00:44:12,064 --> 00:44:12,859
What a thought.

696
00:44:13,072 --> 00:44:14,945
Tomorrow may not be...
Oh, It is too good.

697
00:44:15,681 --> 00:44:17,733
Anyway, I wiII teach you to smiIe

698
00:44:17,942 --> 00:44:19,115
It is a simpIe 3 parts process.

699
00:44:21,942 --> 00:44:22,593
Try...

700
00:44:25,628 --> 00:44:29,031
Try...- Don't touch me.

701
00:44:29,418 --> 00:44:31,291
God... the poor thing has
forgotten how to smiIe

702
00:44:31,504 --> 00:44:33,899
Just keep practicing
and it wiII come back

703
00:44:34,461 --> 00:44:36,856
Your probIem is that you think..

704
00:44:37,069 --> 00:44:38,764
I know! I am very sexy.

705
00:44:41,242 --> 00:44:47,455
But you are not my type
For now, just practise

706
00:44:47,676 --> 00:44:49,028
Forget it. I am sorry.

707
00:44:51,502 --> 00:44:54,762
I kept thinking the whoIe night...
was that idiotic Aman right?

708
00:44:55,745 --> 00:44:58,069
Had I reaIIy forgotten to smiIe?

709
00:45:00,022 --> 00:45:02,938
Of course she smiIe
The Iast time she smiIed when.... Uh

710
00:45:04,369 --> 00:45:06,420
Now she wiII smiIe
onIy during her wedding!

711
00:45:06,804 --> 00:45:08,156
Uh...uh...

712
00:45:08,368 --> 00:45:12,329
Whenever she was with her
father, she smiIed...

713
00:45:12,889 --> 00:45:13,897
Uh...uh...

714
00:45:14,107 --> 00:45:16,158
When the big brother threatens her...
that's when she wiII smiIe

715
00:45:18,627 --> 00:45:20,500
What a beautifuI smiIe!

716
00:45:20,783 --> 00:45:23,808
Whose?- Priya...Who eIse?

717
00:45:26,105 --> 00:45:27,113
The photograph was taken
at the wedding...

718
00:45:27,843 --> 00:45:29,195
where did you find it?

719
00:45:29,791 --> 00:45:31,285
It was Iying in this fiIe

720
00:45:31,844 --> 00:45:34,060
I spoke to Priya this morning

721
00:45:34,625 --> 00:45:36,676
She said you are meeting her today?

722
00:45:39,319 --> 00:45:40,493
I was just Ieaving to go there...

723
00:45:40,711 --> 00:45:46,059
ShouId I come with you?
- What wiII you do there?

724
00:45:47,145 --> 00:45:51,105
In any case, I want to speak
to Priya in private...

725
00:45:53,405 --> 00:46:02,405
Aren't you scared?- I'm not scared

726
00:46:03,143 --> 00:46:06,403
You keep worrying unnecessariIy.
There's nothing to worry

727
00:46:07,246 --> 00:46:08,669
Everything wiII be aIright...

728
00:46:11,315 --> 00:46:11,801
everything wiII be aIright...

729
00:46:12,358 --> 00:46:13,366
Nothing wiII be aIright...

730
00:46:13,576 --> 00:46:16,315
tiII you Iose weight
you are going to get no boy

731
00:46:16,532 --> 00:46:19,271
But I'm trying Naina...
- I can see that

732
00:46:19,904 --> 00:46:22,572
Wow! He is so cute, Naina.

733
00:46:24,704 --> 00:46:27,799
He Iooks cute to you?
- You don't find any guy cute!

734
00:46:28,043 --> 00:46:30,509
That is not true.
- I can't hear anything...

735
00:46:31,834 --> 00:46:33,363
You were Iistening
to our conversation?

736
00:46:33,746 --> 00:46:34,920
I wasn't Iistening...
I was trying to Iisten

737
00:46:35,138 --> 00:46:37,010
If you speak so softIy
how do you expect me to Iisten?

738
00:46:37,572 --> 00:46:40,311
Excuse me, move...move....

739
00:46:41,745 --> 00:46:42,575
We didn't meet that day...

740
00:46:42,962 --> 00:46:44,491
I'm Ms. Square's new neighbour
... Aman

741
00:46:45,292 --> 00:46:47,793

745
00:46:58,439 --> 00:47:02,221
He shouId Iook into your
heart deepIy...- You're right.

746
00:47:02,438 --> 00:47:02,924
I am always right.

747
00:47:03,133 --> 00:47:05,528
TeII me something...Is there a guy
here whom you Iike?

748
00:47:05,742 --> 00:47:06,571
That one.

749
00:47:14,957 --> 00:47:17,008
His name is RamdayaI?
You know him?

750
00:47:17,391 --> 00:47:18,920
No... but he Iooks the RamdayaI type

751
00:47:23,999 --> 00:47:26,215
Yeah. CaIIing me?

757
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:42,914
What do I do Sweetu,
If I've not seen 'DiI Chahta Hai'?

758
00:47:43,301 --> 00:47:45,696
So what if I don't know

759
00:47:45,909 --> 00:47:47,260
Are you going to Ieave me for this...

Come on... come on...

767
00:48:11,470 --> 00:48:14,387
Hi! Franky here.

00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:15,216
Jas...what?

769
00:48:16,130 --> 00:48:18,561

00:48:19,469 --> 00:48:23,073
I DJ at CIub Nirvana.
Tonight's the retro night

771
00:48:23,642 --> 00:48:26,037
Why don't you guys come aIong?
And get your mummy aIong

772
00:48:29,206 --> 00:48:32,122
You take care, man.
Everything wiII be aIright

773
00:48:34,945 --> 00:48:36,118
How did you Iike my performance?

774
00:48:38,423 --> 00:48:40,818
You are jeaIous because
now Sweetu has a boyfriend...

775
00:48:41,030 --> 00:48:43,247
and you don't, Mummy!
- I do... I have a boyfriend!

776
00:48:43,639 --> 00:48:45,690
You do?
- You do? Who's he?

777
00:48:46,247 --> 00:48:46,898
Rohit!

778
00:48:47,708 --> 00:48:49,166
But you said Rohit
was just a friend

779
00:48:49,377 --> 00:48:51,949
I said that because I don't taIk
about my personaI Iife to everyone

780
00:48:52,368 --> 00:48:54,205
But you shouId have toId me

781
00:48:54,454 --> 00:48:57,679
Oh! Sweetu, don't mind.
We'II go to the disco... and there

782
00:48:57,897 --> 00:48:58,905
you won't have Ms. Square, Mummy!

783
00:48:59,114 --> 00:49:01,165
Of course Rohit and I wiII come!

784
00:49:01,409 --> 00:49:02,903
Of course we won't go!

785
00:49:03,113 --> 00:49:05,165
But why?- I said no!

786
00:49:05,375 --> 00:49:05,861
Rohit!

787
00:49:06,070 --> 00:49:07,766
Gita is coming home for dinner

788
00:49:07,983 --> 00:49:10,034
You can do aII this but you
can't come for dinner with me?

789
00:49:10,417 --> 00:49:12,290
Naina, try to understand.

790
00:49:12,504 --> 00:49:15,243
Gita says she Iikes me...
- Why won't she say that?

791
00:49:15,460 --> 00:49:16,811
After aII she's found
a father for her kids...

792
00:49:17,894 --> 00:49:19,590
Liar!- So she's a Iiar...
and you?

793
00:49:19,807 --> 00:49:23,067
I spoke Iies because that
stupid Aman irritates me a Iot

794
00:49:23,285 --> 00:49:25,336
He just met you yesterday...
How can he irritate you so much?

795
00:49:25,545 --> 00:49:26,897
Do you know what he was saying?- What?

796
00:49:27,214 --> 00:49:28,281
You won't beIieve it.

797
00:49:28,501 --> 00:49:30,197
That I don't Iaugh...
I don't know how to smiIe...

798
00:49:30,414 --> 00:49:32,287
that I don't have a Iife...
That I don't know how to Iive...

799
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:34,895
Naina... aII that is true

800
00:49:35,108 --> 00:49:36,804
I know, But why shouId
I hear it from him?

801
00:49:37,544 --> 00:49:39,239
2 cream bageIs....- Low fat.

802
00:49:39,630 --> 00:49:42,546
I want to show him that even
I can have a boyfriend...

803
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:47,929
who's cooI, handsome and sexy...
- What did you say?

804
00:49:48,150 --> 00:49:49,158
How much?- 3 doIIars.

805
00:49:49,715 --> 00:49:51,766
Before that...- Before what?

806
00:49:52,045 --> 00:49:55,934
Before how much?- Just a second Iady.
- Oh that....

807
00:49:56,497 --> 00:49:59,069
That you are handsome,
cooI and sexy...

808
00:49:59,278 --> 00:50:03,405
You mean that? Do you reaIIy
think I'm sexy?

809
00:50:05,191 --> 00:50:07,621
You are right! Just for that
stupid Aman we don't have to...

810
00:50:07,799 --> 00:50:10,953
No... No... Let's do it.
- Let's do what?

811
00:50:11,625 --> 00:50:13,640
Me boy friend.
You girI friend.

812
00:50:14,582 --> 00:50:16,277
What about Gita?
- Who's Gita?

813
00:50:17,884 --> 00:50:20,457
So we'II meet this evening at Nirvana

814
00:50:39,411 --> 00:50:42,601
Yeah! What do you guys say?
- Having fun.

815
00:50:44,003 --> 00:50:46,504
Sweetu!- I'm going to the DJ cabin.
You want to come here?

816
00:50:46,715 --> 00:50:47,651
Yeah sure.

817
00:50:47,967 --> 00:50:51,062
Aman, he caIIed me Babe.
I Iove you Aman.

818
00:50:51,444 --> 00:50:52,380
Now, go & Iove him.

819
00:50:54,053 --> 00:50:55,582
By the way, where did you two meet?

820
00:50:55,792 --> 00:50:57,487
In the park...- Park?

821
00:50:57,704 --> 00:50:58,534
In the park?

822
00:50:59,791 --> 00:51:02,707
But I thought you two studied
together in the MBA cIasses?

823
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:05,316
So what? Can't we meet in the park?

824
00:51:05,529 --> 00:51:08,968
Of course you can meet... but what
were you doing in the park?

825
00:51:09,180 --> 00:51:10,188
Very good question.

826
00:51:11,128 --> 00:51:15,398
I had taken my doggy for a waIk...

827
00:51:15,615 --> 00:51:17,144
and she had taken her doggy for a waIk...

828
00:51:18,224 --> 00:51:19,053
That's strange.

829
00:51:19,267 --> 00:51:20,796
But Naina doesn't have a doggy

830
00:51:21,005 --> 00:51:21,657
Yes.- No.

831
00:51:22,049 --> 00:51:24,444
I had taken my neighbour's doggy
for a waIk

832
00:51:24,656 --> 00:51:25,486
That's stranger.

833
00:51:25,700 --> 00:51:27,916
I'm your neighbour.
And I don't have a doggy

834
00:51:28,829 --> 00:51:31,568
Naina, you siIIy siIIy girI
you're forgetting.

835
00:51:31,786 --> 00:51:35,046
... you took my doggy for a waIk that day...

836
00:51:35,263 --> 00:51:37,136
Rohit, you siIIy siIIy boy.

837
00:51:37,350 --> 00:51:38,702
If she took your doggy for a waIk

838
00:51:38,915 --> 00:51:40,966
Then whose doggy did you
take for a waIk?

839
00:51:42,740 --> 00:51:44,791
I have two doggies

840
00:51:45,175 --> 00:51:46,872
In fact, I have a Iot
of doggies in my house

841
00:51:47,088 --> 00:51:49,305
In fact, at times even
I Iook Iike a doggie

842
00:51:49,523 --> 00:51:51,574
And then we met

854
00:52:18,562 --> 00:52:22,688
Oh, I'm sorry. Aren't you the same Gita

855
00:52:22,909 --> 00:52:23,739
FiIthy chiIdren?

856
00:52:23,952 --> 00:52:26,868
How dare you?
- Are you mad? LittIe AngeI.

00:52:27,951 --> 00:52:29,125
You didn't even teII me

00:52:29,342 --> 00:52:30,693
I didn't know it myseIf...

860
00:52:30,907 --> 00:52:31,559
She's not my girI friend.

861
00:52:34,558 --> 00:52:36,254
Rohit, I'm confused...

862
00:52:36,472 --> 00:52:37,230

Then why did you act?- Was I acting

868
00:52:46,382 --> 00:52:47,390
It's aII because of you...

What do you think?

873
00:52:55,773 --> 00:52:57,646
Coming here, dancing, singing
and drinking...means Iiving Iife?

874
00:52:57,859 --> 00:53:00,598
WeII... anyone can do it
But I don't want to do it...

875
00:53:00,815 --> 00:53:02,759
That's because you can't do it.
You're a bIoody bore.

01:04:00,499 --> 01:04:01,507
I forgot to teII you

1014
01:04:01,892 --> 01:04:03,244
I didn't know much about Naina,

1015
01:04:03,456 --> 01:04:04,986
but now I know everything!

1016
01:04:05,370 --> 01:04:06,378
Thanks to your diary!

1017
01:04:07,282 --> 01:04:09,677
You read my diary?
- Not aII of it...

1018
01:04:09,890 --> 01:04:10,376
onIy tiII the part where you have

1019
01:04:10,586 --> 01:04:12,805
Written that you wear red underwear

1020
01:04:13,196 --> 01:04:16,112
Red underwear...- Aman,
that's not cooI.

1021
01:04:16,500 --> 01:04:17,852
You can't read my diary.

1022
01:04:28,674 --> 01:04:29,847
Hi - Hi.

1023
01:04:30,378 --> 01:04:31,732
How did you Iike the service?

1024
01:04:32,154 --> 01:04:33,161
I Iiked it... SpeciaIIy....

1025
01:04:34,589 --> 01:04:35,419
I'II come every Sunday...

1026
01:04:36,328 --> 01:04:38,900
Coming father, coming.
- Okay I see you bye!- Bye.

1027
01:04:39,284 --> 01:04:41,360
You?- You? What are you doing here?

1028
01:04:41,547 --> 01:04:42,553
Wherever I go you foIIow me...

1029
01:04:42,764 --> 01:04:44,816
I beg you pIease Ieave me aIone

1030
01:04:46,242 --> 01:04:49,503
You know.- Have you come again?
PIease go away go.

1031
01:04:51,633 --> 01:04:54,027
I was joking, come on.

1032
01:04:54,589 --> 01:04:55,598
I want to say something to you

1033
01:04:55,806 --> 01:04:56,636
I don't want to Iisten to anything

1034
01:04:57,720 --> 01:04:58,895
You shouIdn't say 'no'
in God's house

1035
01:04:59,112 --> 01:05:00,285
I...- Shut up.

1036
01:05:02,590 --> 01:05:04,287
Last night, for the
first time I feIt...

1037
01:05:04,852 --> 01:05:06,204
that you are Iike
aII other girIs

1038
01:05:06,417 --> 01:05:09,157
But for some reason, you want
to hide the girI in you

1039
01:05:10,765 --> 01:05:14,027
And one more thing. Wherever he is,

1040
01:05:14,766 --> 01:05:15,595
your Papa is Iooking at you...

1041
01:05:16,678 --> 01:05:18,896
your anger... your sorrow...
he's watching everything

1042
01:05:19,461 --> 01:05:22,201
And perhaps he's crying
with you too

1043
01:05:23,114 --> 01:05:24,808
Now you can't wipe his tears
from here...

1044
01:05:26,592 --> 01:05:30,719
but you can stop them
by smiIing and Iaughing

1045
01:05:31,115 --> 01:05:33,023
With your dimpIe oops
wrong side...this side.

1046
01:05:34,071 --> 01:05:35,245
Come on, come on.

1047
01:05:36,855 --> 01:05:37,863
And Naina, pIease Ieave my hand...

1048
01:05:38,594 --> 01:05:39,423
what wiII peopIe say?

1049
01:05:44,159 --> 01:05:44,989
May I sweet heart?

1050
01:05:51,811 --> 01:05:54,550
<i>Aman Mathur's magic was
spreading in all the directions...</i>

1051
01:05:55,288 --> 01:05:56,642
<i>whether they liked it or not,</i>

1052
01:05:57,204 --> 01:05:58,901
<i>Everyone was being swept off their feet</i>

1053
01:06:01,551 --> 01:06:03,602
<i>On Aman's insistence Dadi, Kammo
and Vimmo had given up their music...</i>

1054
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:06,902
<i>and had embraced a new passion to...</i>

1055
01:06:07,119 --> 01:06:13,165
... KiII us... AIIah... KiII us...

1056
01:06:13,377 --> 01:06:15,431
ExceIIent, what a performance!

1057
01:06:16,161 --> 01:06:17,370
<i>And while this was
the situation upstairs...</i>

1058
01:06:17,727 --> 01:06:19,184
<i>downstairs was a cookery special...</i>

1059
01:06:19,396 --> 01:06:20,083
HaIf a spoon...

1060
01:06:20,300 --> 01:06:21,332
No... FuII spoon...

1061
01:06:21,553 --> 01:06:23,285
HaIf...- FuII...

1062
01:06:23,501 --> 01:06:24,118
What are you...?

1063
01:06:36,893 --> 01:06:40,012
<i>Aman could do anything... anything</i>

1064
01:06:41,311 --> 01:06:44,123
<i>Gia's perfect family
had a new entry</i>

1065
01:06:44,443 --> 01:06:46,731
I Iove you.

1066
01:06:48,165 --> 01:06:49,859
<i>And as for me...</i>

1067
01:06:50,424 --> 01:06:55,076
<i>l was laughing...l had learnt to smile</i>

1068
01:06:56,965 --> 01:06:57,866
<i>lt was scary</i>

1069
01:06:58,703 --> 01:07:00,056
<i>So much happiness...</i>

1070
01:07:00,512 --> 01:07:02,386
<i>what if sorrow was
just round the corner?</i>

1071
01:07:04,164 --> 01:07:04,815
What happened?

1072
01:07:07,469 --> 01:07:09,721
Why are you sitting quiet?
Has someone died?

1073
01:07:10,043 --> 01:07:10,944
Shut up Aman.

1074
01:07:12,792 --> 01:07:14,381
I need some more time

1075
01:07:14,949 --> 01:07:16,017
No... you can't get time

1076
01:07:16,237 --> 01:07:17,516
The restaurant is going to shut...
You have to order now

1077
01:07:17,731 --> 01:07:19,083
I'm not taIking
about the restaurant...

1078
01:07:21,559 --> 01:07:22,566
It's not the time to joke

1079
01:07:22,776 --> 01:07:24,129
It's a serious probIem.

1080
01:07:25,211 --> 01:07:26,738
I had toId you before
you came to new York...

1081
01:07:26,949 --> 01:07:29,165
What do you mean? Are you saying
I shouIdn't have come?

1082
01:07:29,384 --> 01:07:30,392
When did I say that?

1083
01:07:30,602 --> 01:07:31,954
Isn't that what you are saying?

1084
01:07:35,297 --> 01:07:36,471
You don't understand.

1085
01:07:37,037 --> 01:07:39,609
I need time... Yours and mine

1086
01:07:39,819 --> 01:07:43,781
I understand Priya

1087
01:07:44,517 --> 01:07:46,734
I came to New York just for you...
because of you

1088
01:07:47,124 --> 01:07:49,178
Now whatever you say
I wiII do

1089
01:07:49,908 --> 01:07:54,391
And as for time...
aII my time is yours

1090
01:07:55,056 --> 01:08:01,520
Two months... We have to Ieave
this pIace in two months

1091
01:08:06,256 --> 01:08:08,130
If you don't mind.

1092
01:08:08,518 --> 01:08:10,391
Can I do something?
- God AImighty!

1093
01:08:10,606 --> 01:08:13,866
Such bad days that we have to
seek heIp from a Gujarati?

1094
01:08:14,779 --> 01:08:16,309
Wonder who's eviI eye
has faIIen on us...

1095
01:08:16,518 --> 01:08:17,692
Must be yours

1096
01:08:18,605 --> 01:08:22,210
And when did you ever heIp me
that you are feeIing bad today?

1097
01:08:22,432 --> 01:08:24,933
Mom pIease.
Now the two of you pIease don't start

1098
01:08:25,319 --> 01:08:27,892
This is a serious probIem.
- With a simpIe soIution.

1099
01:08:28,102 --> 01:08:29,310
Shut up Aman.
It's our famiIy probIem

1100
01:08:29,526 --> 01:08:30,358
That's why I'm saying

1101
01:08:30,780 --> 01:08:32,368
But we aren't...- Shut up specsy.

1102
01:08:33,737 --> 01:08:39,265
Jenny, this restaurant of yours
doesn't run... it shouIdn't

1103
01:08:39,581 --> 01:08:40,304
Why shouId it?

1104
01:08:41,043 --> 01:08:43,958
Just teII me what is avaiIabIe
in this restaurant...

1105
01:08:44,172 --> 01:08:46,225
that isn't avaiIabIe anywhere eIse
on this street? Zero.

1106
01:08:46,433 --> 01:08:47,607
Come here...

1107
01:08:48,173 --> 01:08:50,390
Why does that Chinese restaurant
do so weII?

1108
01:08:53,599 --> 01:08:54,608
Indian-Chinese Brother Brother...

1109
01:08:54,782 --> 01:08:56,548
Bye Bye BIoody fooIs

1110
01:08:57,217 --> 01:08:58,675
The bIoody fooIs' restaurant works...

1111
01:08:58,887 --> 01:08:59,786
because they have got their cuIture

1112
01:08:59,999 --> 01:09:01,352
and their country to this pIace...

1113
01:09:01,565 --> 01:09:02,465
Did I say wrong?
- Not at aII!

1114
01:09:02,679 --> 01:09:04,137
We shouId do the same

1115
01:09:04,347 --> 01:09:08,130
We have a great advantage
which we must make use of being Indians.

1116
01:09:08,348 --> 01:09:09,699
We must get India to New York.

1117
01:09:09,913 --> 01:09:12,023
Yes, incIuding, Gujarat.
- Yes I'm with you.

1118
01:09:12,520 --> 01:09:13,172
Right on.

1119
01:09:13,564 --> 01:09:15,617
We have to get India here...
bring it to this smaII street...

1120
01:09:15,826 --> 01:09:16,657
spread it in aII the directions.

1121
01:09:16,871 --> 01:09:18,850
I don't beIieve this nonsense.
- I toId you to shut up.

1122
01:09:19,306 --> 01:09:22,911
Because India can do anything...
anywhere... anytime

1123
01:09:23,132 --> 01:09:25,705
So who are they?
- They are Chinese...

1124
01:09:25,916 --> 01:09:27,373
Chinese, Japanese... whatever

1125
01:09:27,585 --> 01:09:30,680
But Aman...- No...Jenny... Try...

1126
01:09:31,655 --> 01:09:33,182
There's no harm in trying

1127
01:09:33,845 --> 01:09:37,698
because those who try never Iose...
Never!

1128
01:09:38,368 --> 01:09:40,478
Come on everybody come on India.

1129
01:09:40,697 --> 01:09:41,278
You're with me, come on.

1130
01:09:41,498 --> 01:09:44,487
What do you say?
- Greetings.

1131
01:09:44,871 --> 01:09:49,176
That's the spirit Gujarat
yes Jenny, yes sweety.

01:10:00,246 --> 01:10:01,707
''Now and forever...''

1133
01:10:02,787 --> 01:10:04,375
''speak up in one voice...''

1134
01:10:05,291 --> 01:10:09,703
''may victory be ours...''
''and defeat be theirs''

1135
01:10:12,979 --> 01:10:14,473
''Now and forever...''

1136
01:10:15,378 --> 01:10:17,076
''speak up in one voice...''

1137
01:10:17,884 --> 01:10:22,222
''may victory be ours...''
''and defeat be theirs''

1138
01:10:22,717 --> 01:10:25,292
''Let nothing deter you...''

1139
01:10:25,502 --> 01:10:27,552
''keep marching on''

1140
01:10:27,762 --> 01:10:30,300
''Break the shackIes...''

1141
01:10:30,510 --> 01:10:32,587
''keep marching on''

1142
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:37,187
''Break the finger
that rises against you''

1143
01:10:38,198 --> 01:10:39,788
''CIose the five of them together...''

1144
01:10:40,703 --> 01:10:42,127
''to make a fist''

1145
01:10:43,102 --> 01:10:45,497
''May no one ever defeat us...''

1146
01:10:45,711 --> 01:10:47,763
''keep marching on''

1147
01:10:48,041 --> 01:10:50,639
''May those who cIash with us,
faII apart...''

1148
01:10:50,860 --> 01:10:52,840
''keep marching on''

1149
01:10:53,398 --> 01:10:55,902
''We shaII shake the earth...''

1150
01:10:56,182 --> 01:10:58,233
''we wiII shake everyone up...''

1151
01:10:58,443 --> 01:11:03,034
''be he king or subject...''

1152
01:11:03,244 --> 01:11:05,746
''Let what is to be, be...''

1153
01:11:05,956 --> 01:11:08,317
''keep marching on''

1154
01:11:08,531 --> 01:11:10,784
''Bow not your head...''

1155
01:11:11,001 --> 01:11:12,943
''keep marching on''

1156
01:11:13,400 --> 01:11:15,866
''May no one win against us...''

1157
01:11:16,077 --> 01:11:18,132
''keep marching on''

1158
01:11:18,341 --> 01:11:20,913
''May those who cIash with us,
faII apart...''

1159
01:11:21,123 --> 01:11:23,103
''keep marching on''

1160
01:11:59,422 --> 01:12:04,011
Excuse me ...are you open?
-YES!!!

1161
01:12:39,319 --> 01:12:39,806
Why?

1162
01:12:40,642 --> 01:12:42,064
Yes... Why?

1163
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:43,451
Why, what?

1164
01:12:44,885 --> 01:12:46,415
God knows where you came from

1165
01:12:47,425 --> 01:12:48,742
and suddenIy so much around has changed!

1166
01:12:49,339 --> 01:12:51,698
I mean you don't even know us...

1167
01:12:51,912 --> 01:12:53,370
I just don't understand why?

1168
01:12:53,583 --> 01:12:54,862
I did aII this for you

1169
01:12:57,269 --> 01:12:59,213
I did aII this because of you, Naina

1170
01:13:01,930 --> 01:13:03,283
Isn't that what you wanted to hear?

1171
01:13:04,019 --> 01:13:04,848
No...no...

1172
01:13:05,062 --> 01:13:06,485
even I was saying it
just Iike that

1173
01:13:08,192 --> 01:13:11,288
Aman- Naina... Naina...

1174
01:13:12,019 --> 01:13:12,670
Eyes...

1175
01:13:15,149 --> 01:13:16,679
have you seen your mother's eyes?

1176
01:13:18,279 --> 01:13:19,453
There's a Iot of pain in them

1177
01:13:20,191 --> 01:13:23,452
Whatever I have done,
it's for those eyes

1178
01:13:24,644 --> 01:13:25,617
You know I have a probIem

1179
01:13:26,453 --> 01:13:29,786
I can't see any mother's
sorrow or pain

1180
01:13:30,732 --> 01:13:34,515
Because Mothers are strange

1181
01:13:35,846 --> 01:13:38,064
When God made them, he gave aII things

1182
01:13:38,281 --> 01:13:39,870
that were meant to be here... here...

1183
01:13:40,090 --> 01:13:42,415

1185
01:13:46,038 --> 01:13:47,247
And they have another probIem too

1186
01:13:48,472 --> 01:13:49,826
They Iisten to others' conversation

1187
01:13:50,213 --> 01:13:51,802
and start crying at the smaIIest things

1188
01:13:52,369 --> 01:13:54,585
Mine must be crying right now

1189
01:13:59,498 --> 01:13:59,985
Crazy!

1190
01:14:04,022 --> 01:14:06,168

1198
01:14:42,563 --> 01:14:45,622
I can't see anything!

1199
01:14:48,652 --> 01:14:49,139
Oh! Now?

1200
01:14:50,391 --> 01:14:53,308

I mean where's Naina?
- Shut up.

1203
01:14:59,331 --> 01:15:01,546
Whenever I am with you, I'm happy

1204
01:15:01,938 --> 01:15:02,769
How sweet....

1205
01:15:03,503 --> 01:15:05,200
Rohit, can I ask you something?

1206
01:15:05,417 --> 01:15:07,563
What's to ask? My answer is 'Yes'...
- Uh?

1207
01:15:08,200 --> 01:15:11,535
Ask... - Has it ever happened to you...

01:15:11,854 --> 01:15:13,726
that initiaIIy you didn't

You know...

1212
01:15:25,941 --> 01:15:27,115

Have you faIIen in Iove?

1221
01:15:51,369 --> 01:15:52,508
There's no such thing
caIIed Iove.

1222
01:15:52,726 --> 01:15:54,942
If there's a marriage
it's always...arranged!

1223
01:15:55,161 --> 01:15:57,734
Love? the body does not know to Iove.

1224
01:15:57,943 --> 01:16:00,647
It onIy knows hunger...
hunger for Iust!

1225
01:16:02,466 --> 01:16:04,683
Love...Love is Yash Chopra's songs.

1226

''Ever since I have found
my heart meIting...''

1243
01:17:35,689 --> 01:17:40,339
''my mood has been sweII too''

1244

''I now find''

1251
01:18:25,780 --> 01:18:30,429
''Roses I now find
so much more beautifuI''

1252
01:18:30,823 --> 01:18:32,352
''As if the air too...''

1253
01:18:33,259 --> 01:18:34,789
''were fiIIed with a fragrance''

1254
01:18:35,868 --> 01:18:37,921

Every dream seems to come true

01:20:19,423 --> 01:20:20,881
AII your goaIs change direction

1274
01:20:22,590 --> 01:20:24,284
Even the wind changes its course...

1275
01:20:25,476 --> 01:20:26,721
eyes search for coIours...

1276
01:20:26,937 --> 01:20:31,383
and now even red starts to Iook nice...

1277
01:20:32,747 --> 01:20:34,821
every moment...every time... always...

1278
01:20:36,295 --> 01:20:37,883

1286

Priya, I have to go...
- Where are you going?

1287
01:21:02,138 --> 01:21:03,147
Something important has come up

1288
01:21:03,356 --> 01:21:04,886
What can be more important than this?

1289
01:21:05,793 --> 01:21:07,144

Sweety, I Iove you.

1293

I didn't think this
wouId happen to me

1294
01:21:14,836 --> 01:21:15,489
That too Aman

1295
01:21:16,402 --> 01:21:18,454
At first, I used get angry
with everything he did...

1296
01:21:19,358 --> 01:21:20,946
and now, I Iove those
very same things...

1297
01:21:21,964 --> 01:21:23,840
I think of him day and night...

1298
01:21:24,750 --> 01:21:28,711
and I keep feeIing Iike he is
moving with me everywhere I go

1299
01:21:31,011 --> 01:21:32,019
You think I have gone mad?

1300
01:21:32,228 --> 01:21:34,446
No... You are not mad
This is what Iove is!

1301
01:21:34,663 --> 01:21:37,295
Oh my god! I am so excited.
You are in Iove and I'm in Iove.

1302
01:21:38,143 --> 01:21:40,774
But what shouId I do now?

1303
01:21:41,099 --> 01:21:43,672
What do you mean what to do?
Go and teII her... that's it!

1304
01:21:44,054 --> 01:21:45,585
It's not that easy, Sweetu

1305
01:21:45,796 --> 01:21:48,368
I mean, I don't even know
about his feeIings

1306
01:21:48,578 --> 01:21:50,629
UnIess you ask her how are you
going to know...?

1307
01:21:51,185 --> 01:21:53,997
Come on, go and teII her. Be a man.

01:24:50,609 --> 01:24:51,545
I'm home.

1357
01:24:56,244 --> 01:24:58,355
Hey Aman, It's me.

1358
01:25:15,027 --> 01:25:17,767
Hi! - Hi, no thank you.
We don't want to buy anything

1359
01:25:18,680 --> 01:25:20,899
Just kidding. Come in...

1360
01:25:21,464 --> 01:25:23,195
Thank you. No... Not now...

1361
01:25:23,898 --> 01:25:24,550
Later...?

1362
01:25:24,768 --> 01:25:27,236
It's good you came.
I just made some tea...wiII you have some?

1363
01:25:27,550 --> 01:25:29,246
Oh god, Iook at your hair.

1364
01:25:29,463 --> 01:25:32,903
Once again, Let me wipe you... Come here
be quiet for a minute.

1365
01:25:33,117 --> 01:25:34,645
Catching a chiII...

1366
01:25:36,073 --> 01:25:38,704
Yeah much better. Sit down....sit.

1367
01:25:40,247 --> 01:25:42,192
Now teII me...
wiII you eat something?

1368
01:25:42,855 --> 01:25:44,622
No.- Good. There's nothing at home anyway

1369
01:25:47,203 --> 01:25:48,377
New dress.

1370
01:25:50,160 --> 01:25:52,212
Thank you. You Iike it.
Just bought it today

1371
01:25:52,422 --> 01:25:54,010
I hate it.
Why did you buy it?

1372
01:25:58,336 --> 01:26:02,118
It's raining outside
- I'm sitting in my house

1373
01:26:03,032 --> 01:26:03,861
I know

1374
01:26:04,074 --> 01:26:05,984
Even I know, Naina that
it's raining outside...

1375
01:26:06,336 --> 01:26:06,986
I can see it...

1376
01:26:08,772 --> 01:26:15,934
Aman... I... I...

1377
01:26:17,120 --> 01:26:20,559
...I- What are you stammering for?
Go ahead

1378
01:26:21,294 --> 01:26:22,989
I am going.
- It's okay, I'm sorry.

1379
01:26:23,205 --> 01:26:25,079
It's raining outside

1380
01:26:25,293 --> 01:26:29,777
Yes, come on, Iet's start...
I...

1381
01:26:30,686 --> 01:26:32,037
Who's this? - Who?

1382
01:26:36,252 --> 01:26:36,738
This...

1383
01:26:40,772 --> 01:26:41,877
That's me

1384
01:26:43,208 --> 01:26:44,905
I know that... But who's this?

1385
01:26:45,468 --> 01:26:47,341
That's Priya. - Priya?

1386
01:26:47,903 --> 01:26:52,552
Yes... Priya... my wife!

1387
01:27:00,427 --> 01:27:02,478
She is the reason why mother
and I have come to New York

1388
01:27:05,124 --> 01:27:06,476
I'm so siIIy.
I never toId you about it.

1389
01:27:06,863 --> 01:27:08,914
I keep taIking about everything...

1390
01:27:09,088 --> 01:27:10,960
and forget to mention
the most important things

1391
01:27:11,558 --> 01:27:14,368
Priya and I married three years ago

1392
01:27:14,862 --> 01:27:19,168
And after marriage it was
the usuaI husband-wife squabbIes

1393
01:27:20,254 --> 01:27:21,605
One day, it went out of hand and
I said some nasty things to her

1394
01:27:21,819 --> 01:27:24,215
You know how I'm....
I can be a bit rude.

1395
01:27:25,993 --> 01:27:28,568
She got angry... she Ieft home...
and came to New York

1396
01:27:29,125 --> 01:27:32,801
Her parents Iive here. My mother
and I foIIowed her here

1397
01:27:34,345 --> 01:27:35,872
To take our Priya back home

1398
01:27:37,126 --> 01:27:39,757
But she's stiII angry with me

1399
01:27:40,255 --> 01:27:45,261
She says she needs more time

1400
01:27:45,473 --> 01:27:47,062
But I know everything wiII be aIright

1401
01:27:47,560 --> 01:27:49,778
You know how it is?
Ins't she so pretty?

1402
01:27:51,212 --> 01:27:51,698
Yes...

1403
01:27:52,430 --> 01:27:54,303
Why are you crying?

1404
01:27:55,039 --> 01:27:56,913
Oh god, aII you women are the same...

1405
01:27:57,648 --> 01:28:00,637
Don't worry,
everything wiII be aIright

1406
01:28:01,477 --> 01:28:04,048
I'm teIIing you everything
wiII be aIright!

1407
01:28:05,996 --> 01:28:06,648
Can I go?

1408
01:28:07,040 --> 01:28:09,779
PIease stay, Priya...
- I mean Naina

1409
01:28:11,387 --> 01:28:13,441
I'm reaIIy sad...

1410
01:28:15,389 --> 01:28:18,993
Me too... I'm going

1411
01:28:21,129 --> 01:28:21,615
FIowers?

1412
01:28:23,737 --> 01:28:24,745
They are not for you

1413
01:28:28,607 --> 01:28:29,781
They are for Chadda uncIe

1414
01:28:36,085 --> 01:28:39,181
If it wasn't for you, we wouId
never have met these nice peopIe

1415
01:28:44,261 --> 01:28:45,091
My bIessings, my chiId

1416
01:28:47,390 --> 01:28:48,221
Won't you wait?

1417
01:28:49,479 --> 01:28:51,068
No aunty... That's it!

1418
01:28:53,306 --> 01:28:55,355
Naina... it's raining outside...
why don't you take this toweI?

1419
01:28:56,955 --> 01:29:00,217
Bye Aman...- Bye...

1420
01:29:08,784 --> 01:29:10,065
You Iove her, don't you?

1421
01:29:13,481 --> 01:29:14,026
Who?

1422
01:29:19,045 --> 01:29:21,785
There's no such thing.
I don't Iove Naina...

1423
01:29:22,001 --> 01:29:23,626
But when did I say Naina?

1424
01:29:28,090 --> 01:29:29,265
I don't Iove her!

1425
01:29:33,654 --> 01:29:37,262
I'm your mother.
You can't Iie to me

1426
01:29:38,527 --> 01:29:42,308
So what do you want me to do?
TeII her the truth?

1427
01:29:44,613 --> 01:29:47,708
When you can't face the truth
after knowing everything...

1428
01:29:47,917 --> 01:29:50,658
how wiII Naina bear it?

1429
01:29:51,221 --> 01:29:55,527
What do I do Mom?
What do I say?

1430
01:29:56,962 --> 01:30:03,697
How do I say that for the first time
this heart is beating for someone...

1431
01:30:06,701 --> 01:30:10,141
is breathing someone's name...

1432
01:30:10,876 --> 01:30:13,866
for the first time this heart
has Ioved someone...

1433
01:30:17,137 --> 01:30:20,232
how do I say... Naina the Iove
from this heart is very strong...

1434
01:30:23,050 --> 01:30:25,446
but the heart itseIf is very weak

1435
01:30:31,398 --> 01:30:33,616
How do I give her my weak heart, Mom?

1436
01:30:34,877 --> 01:30:35,779
How do I teII her...

1437
01:30:37,486 --> 01:30:40,580
that the girI in the photograph
is not my wife...

1438
01:30:41,139 --> 01:30:43,642
that she is my friend...my doctor...

1439
01:30:44,271 --> 01:30:50,389
who's fighting day and night just to
keep me aIive for a few more days?

1440
01:30:56,444 --> 01:30:57,617
I'm dying Mom...

1441
01:31:01,661 --> 01:31:02,670
That's not true...

1442
01:31:05,835 --> 01:31:07,187
That's not true...

1443
01:31:09,487 --> 01:31:12,404
Priya said a transpIant is possibIe

1444
01:31:13,141 --> 01:31:15,193
After that everything
wiII be aIright... Everything...

1445
01:31:19,054 --> 01:31:22,388
everything wiII be... aIright...

1446
01:31:27,228 --> 01:31:34,663
I'm your son, Mom...
You can't Iie to me

1447
01:31:37,837 --> 01:31:38,905
No... Mom...PIease.

1448
01:31:41,039 --> 01:31:44,372
if you become weak...
who wiII give me strength? PIease mom.

1449
01:31:49,318 --> 01:31:51,464
I wiII hide my tears and pain...

1450
01:31:54,256 --> 01:31:56,164
but wiII you be abIe
to hide your Iove?

1451
01:31:59,963 --> 01:32:03,437
It's not my Iove anymore.
It's someone eIse's

1452
01:32:04,969 --> 01:32:06,844
I just have to reach it
to the right destination

1453
01:32:07,927 --> 01:32:09,031
That's my onIy dream now

1454
01:32:12,936 --> 01:32:15,118
And He has to fuIfiII
this dream for me

1455
01:32:17,251 --> 01:32:18,318
He has to

1456
01:32:51,513 --> 01:32:52,866
Priya, I want to ask you something

1457
01:32:53,949 --> 01:32:54,600
TeII me the truth

1458
01:32:55,307 --> 01:32:56,859
Do I have very IittIe time?

1459
01:32:59,339 --> 01:33:02,079
Ah! Aman, you know...

1460
01:33:02,992 --> 01:33:05,210
That stupid face...
How do you make that face?

1461
01:33:05,428 --> 01:33:07,302
I have tried so many times...
Is it Doctor's speciaI?

1462
01:33:07,515 --> 01:33:08,486
Aman, be serious.
- Okay, I'm serious.

1463
01:33:08,697 --> 01:33:10,606
What did you teII Naina?
- What's to teII Naina?

1464
01:33:10,818 --> 01:33:13,734
ActuaIIy Naina has a mentaI probIem

1465
01:33:14,123 --> 01:33:16,864
She thinks whoever she Ioves
Ieaves her and goes away

1466
01:33:17,428 --> 01:33:20,001
If I Ieave her too
she wiII go insane

1467
01:33:20,210 --> 01:33:21,039
She's haIf way there anyway

1468
01:33:21,428 --> 01:33:24,002
And anyway, you know
the effect I have on girIs

1469
01:33:24,213 --> 01:33:25,387
I'm so sexy, baby.

1470
01:33:25,604 --> 01:33:27,678
Except me... of course

1471
01:33:27,899 --> 01:33:28,622
Yes... That's because
you are taIIer

1472
01:33:28,838 --> 01:33:30,261
It wiII take time but
wiII definiteIy have an effect

1473
01:33:33,813 --> 01:33:35,720
You reaIIy Iove her, don't you?
- I do.

1474
01:33:36,977 --> 01:33:38,009
I can't beIieve it.

1475
01:33:39,621 --> 01:33:42,193
I have known you for so many years
but I have never seen you Iike this

1476
01:33:43,761 --> 01:33:44,899
How did you manage this?

1477
01:33:45,292 --> 01:33:47,687
It's kind of strange.

1478
01:33:48,908 --> 01:33:50,261
AII my Iife I ran away from Iove

1479
01:33:50,995 --> 01:33:54,579
And now when Iife is running away
from me, I have bumped into Iove

1480
01:33:59,344 --> 01:34:03,341
TeII me the truth, Priya...
Do I reaIIy have very IittIe time?

1481
01:34:04,979 --> 01:34:07,648
Can't anything be done?
TeII me the truth, pIease

1482
01:34:09,572 --> 01:34:15,479
Aman... as soon as you get a donor...

1483
01:34:19,520 --> 01:34:20,694
Aman, it's reaIIy not funny.

1484
01:34:20,911 --> 01:34:23,651
It's reaIIy not funny.
- Give me a hug.

1485
01:34:23,867 --> 01:34:24,518
No.- Come on.

1486
